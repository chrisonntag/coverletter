# Cover Letter Template
This is my interpretation for a LaTeX cover letter template inspired by the wonderful CV template from [Zeyi Fan](https://github.com/fanzeyi). 
You can preview it the PDF [here](./dist/coverletter.pdf).

## Font
This template uses [Raleway](https://github.com/impallari/Raleway) as the main font, which is also open source!

## Build
Use latexmk:
```
    latexmk -xelatex -outdir=dist [-pvc for live updates]
```

## License
LaTeX Project Public License 1.3c
